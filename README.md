# What is ToDoApp, and what can this app do?

- ToDoApp is a basic ToDoList application which you can create categories and items inside them
- The App, stores your data inside your iOS device
- When you create a new category, it gives you a random color for the category
- By the help of the ChameleonFramework, the textColors are contrasted to make it more visible for user
- You put a checkmark to the items by selecting, so that it makes easier for you to see what items you have done inside your list
- You can delete objects (either a Category, or an Item) by swiping
- You can query the items inside your list
